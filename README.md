# Tibber

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

Tibber is a TBR (To Be Read) book management app similar to GoodReads that I built to keep track of the books I am reading. It allows you to search with the Google Books API and save books to your TBR, set as Currently Reading, and add to a queue . I made this to practice with React, Next.js, and Prisma while learning about the T3 stack and tRPC
